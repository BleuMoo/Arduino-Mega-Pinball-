# Arduino-Mega-Pinball-
Decided to write a program from scratch, based on the other projects. 
This way, we will be able to have full control, understanding, and a clear view of the controls. It will be easy to make edits on the go. 
Also, everyone is welcome to contribute their ideas, as long as they are compatible with the controller and code.
